Word Search Puzzle

Given a collection of letters which contain hidden words (in the file WORDSEARCH.TXT), find all of the words
in the word list (in the file WORDLIST.TXT) within the puzzle.  Remember, the words may be hidden left to right,
right to left, up, down or diagonally.

Create a console application which will search the puzzle for the words contained in the list.  Your output should
note which word you found, where you found it and one of the following designations for the direction the word takes:

LR – Left to right
RL – Right to left
U – Up
D – Down
DUL – Diagonal up left
DUR – Diagonal up right
DDL – Diagonal down left
DDR – Diagonal down right

Your deliverable for this exercise will be the console application and all supporting modules necessary to compile
and run your solution.

There is no “right” solution to this problem.  We are simply trying to determine how you approach the problem, how
comfortable you are with C# and the quality of the output you deliver.  Solid, well performing code always wins out
over clever code.  If you have any questions about this exercise, please contact me at dave.ferreira@nordstrom.com.

Good luck and happy coding!
